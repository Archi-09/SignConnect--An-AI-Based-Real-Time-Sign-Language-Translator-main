# SignConnect – An AI-Based Real-Time Sign Language Translator

## 📌 Overview
SignConnect is an AI-powered, real-time sign language translation system designed to bridge the communication gap between sign-language users and non-sign-language users. The system enables **bidirectional translation** between sign language and text/speech using computer vision, deep learning, and multilingual NLP models.

The project primarily focuses on **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** and aims to improve accessibility in education, healthcare, public services, and workplaces.
